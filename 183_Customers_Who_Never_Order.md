# Customers Who Never Order
Suppose that a website contains two tables, the Customers table and the Orders table. Write a SQL query to find all customers who never order anything.

Table: Customers.
```
+----+-------+
| Id | Name  |
+----+-------+
| 1  | Joe   |
| 2  | Henry |
| 3  | Sam   |
| 4  | Max   |
+----+-------+
```
Table: Orders.
```
+----+------------+
| Id | CustomerId |
+----+------------+
| 1  | 3          |
| 2  | 1          |
+----+------------+
```
Using the above tables as example, return the following:
```
+-----------+
| Customers |
+-----------+
| Henry     |
| Max       |
+-----------+
```
## Solution
```sql
# Write your MySQL query statement below
select Customers from (select Customers.Name as Customers, Orders.CustomerId as customerid  from Customers left join Orders on Customers.Id = Orders.CustomerId) as newtable where customerid is null;
```
